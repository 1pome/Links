# LinkTree Free Clone

LinkTree Free Clone is a free clone of LinkTree, a popular link aggregator for social media. 

It is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Feel free to use it as a template for your own projects.

## üöÄ Quick start

1. **Customize your general settings**

   Open `src/config.ts` and edit the `SUBTITLE', 'TITLE' and 'TAGLINE' variables.

2. **Customize your links**

    Create a new file in `src/pages/links/` for each link you want to add.
    The file name will be not used, but it is recommended to use a descriptive name.
    The file should contain a frontmatter section with the following variables:
        * `title`: The title of the link
        * `emoji`: The emoji to use for the link
        * `href`: The URL of the link

    Example:
    ```md
    ---

    title: Link 1
    emoji: üì∫
    href: https://lorem.com

    ---
    ```

3. **Customize your avatar**

    Replace the file `src/public/avatar.jpg` with your own avatar.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
